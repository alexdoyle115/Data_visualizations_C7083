#### 1.0 Introduction 


The Big Mac was invented by The Economist in 1986 as a way to compare a currencies exchange rate and its purchasing power. The index is based off of the theory of purchasing-power parity (PPP) which says that in the long-term exchange rates would shift to a point where prices for the same goods should be equalized. The infographic below from the economist website outlines the theory very well and can be found [**here**](https://infographics.economist.com/2018/big-mac/images/bigmac_INTRO_ai2html-raw2.png). The index is updated biannually by The Economist and an interactive app is available [**here**](https://www.economist.com/big-mac-index)

The continents data set from [**Data Hub**](https://datahub.io/) and can be found [**here**](https://datahub.io/JohnSnowLabs/country-and-continent-codes-list) and was created by [**John Snow LABS**](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/) provided a link between the 3 letter country codes used in the data and the 2 letter country codes that ggflags runs on.

The basis of PPP says that exchange rates should trend towards a point where long-term exchange rates should shift towards a point where the same goods and services have the same price. In the real world this theory is impacted by factors such as poverty,  tariffs and the imperfectness of real-world economics (Lian, L., Lan, Y., 2003 ). Despite this it was worth looking at the extremes of the Big Mac index. By taking the minimum and maximum of each date to see if overvaluations and undervaluation were decreasing. It appears to be increasing but this may be due to more countries being added as the years go by.

#### 1.2 Graph 2.2 - The GGplot

```{r plot 2.2, echo = FALSE}
# Creating a data set that contaings multiple points for the lolipop plot
# this contains the information for 2002
lolipop <- big_mac %>%
  filter(date == "2002-04-01")%>%
  select(2, 4, 8) %>%
  rename(start = usd_raw)

# this contains the information for now
now <- big_mac %>%
  filter(date == "2020-07-01") %>%
  select(4, 8) %>%
  rename(now = usd_raw)


lolipop <- lolipop %>%
  inner_join(now, by = c("name")) %>% # joining them together
  cbind(center = "0") %>%  # adding 0
  mutate(center = as.numeric(center))%>% 
  mutate(diff =  abs((start^2) - (now^2))) %>% # create new variable to compare the differences
  arrange(diff) %>% # and arrange by them
  slice(8:32 ) %>% # removing the countrys with the smallest change 
  #(to leave more room in the plot) they change < 1%
  mutate(
    start = start*100, 
    now = now*100
  ) # multiply by 100 to show the values in percent 
 
```




```{r matching codes, include = FALSE }

# adding the continent data to add the two letter code needed for the ggflags package
continents <- continent %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  select(two_letter_country_code, three_letter_country_code)%>%
  rename(code_2 = two_letter_country_code, 
         iso_a3 = three_letter_country_code) %>%
  mutate(code_2 = tolower(code_2))

lolipop_a <- lolipop %>% 
  inner_join(continents, by = c("iso_a3"))
  
  
```

Moving now to look at for a trend in how valuations have changed over time. Using a cleveland plot for this type of visualization was suitable as it shows the change in valuation over time. Another approach would be to use a line graph to explore the various paths of the data, but it would be a very difficult diagram to read. Instead focusing on start and end points it offers the more generalized view that in comparison to the UD$ the valuation at least in terms of Big Macs is trending towards currencies being undervalued.

#### 1.3 Graph 2.3 The Shiny App
The interactivity and flexibility that a shiny app enables to quickly display reactive information made it perfect for displaying information such as this. With the time series data as well as the different indexes available to show trying to use a traditional graph would have resulted in complex mess. The Shiny app allows a user to display whatever countries they so choose and in terms of the scale they want (Exchange Rate, Local Price or Value).

         value_rel = dollar_price/dollar_price[rank==1]) %>% # compares them to each other and ranks them
